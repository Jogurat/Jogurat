### Hi there 👋

I'm Petar, aka Jogurat (Yo-goo-rat, or Joe-goo-rat, either works 😇). In another life I was a Minecraft youtuber with a whopping 500 subscribers, nowadays, I enjoy hikes, gaming, and if the time allows it, anime.

Oh, and I **love** coding too. From apps that allow me to [watch movies in sync](https://github.com/Jogurat/sync-me-app) with my friends over the Internet (damn you, pandemic!), to [silly Discord music quiz bots](https://github.com/Jogurat/quizby) that helps us expose the closeted Hannah Montannah fans, I thrive when building stuff others would find joy using. 

Lately, I've started exploring my creative and "content" side, and I'm [currently streaming](https://www.twitch.tv/jogurat/) the making of a Geoguessr clone for the game of VALORANT, which I fittingly named **Valoguessr**! (fingers crossed that I actually finish it 🤞)

Also, I'm in the process of writing a blog-post titled "_Making a Heroku-like DX using Docker & Github Actions_". 🤓

- 🐱‍💻 If I'm working on a project, I'm probably using:  [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- 📕 Currently enjoying learning these: [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), [K8s](https://kubernetes.io/), [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), Game Network Programming
